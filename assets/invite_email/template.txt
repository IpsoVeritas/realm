About the Integrity app

The Integrity app is your secure digital passport. You use it 
to interact with services that use Integrity's decentralized 
infrastructure. You have control of the information in the passport, 
which belongs to you and resides in your device, and it is operated 
independently from the realms that you access. When you share data 
with a service, only you and the service you share with can see 
the transaction.

best regards,
